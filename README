To compile this on Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty), you may need to install the
following packages:

  scons libclutter-0.9-dev libgflags-dev \
  libgtest-dev libprotobuf-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev

To build the 'wm' executable, run 'scons wm'.

To run the window manager under Xephyr, a nested X server, use
'run_in_xephyr.sh'.  There are some parameters that you can change by
setting variables in the script's environment, e.g.
'resolution=640x480 ./run_in_xephyr.sh'.

Xephyr doesn't seem to support GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap (although a
nested glxinfo reports that it's present).  If you see a warning about
this, it means that every time a window updates, the changes will need to
be copied through the X server on their way to the video card.
